# Codefights Solutions

In this repository I'm collecting my solutions for tasks on codefights.com.

Don't trick yourself by just copy & pasting the solutions. You won't get better.

If there is anything to improve or can be coded shorter, please let me know and create a pull request. I'm happy about any suggestions!
